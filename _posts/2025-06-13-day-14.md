what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned more about the actual project that my group is working on. All of the gorup memebers are building our own spearate codes to get a good accuray for our codes with the machine learning modeles. My algorithem at this current momement is not working as well I would like it to. I need to learn how disect the code and use the LLM's to imporve it. I also did a little bit of work on understading META-Adv a little better.

reflection: |
  Today was easy with developing the code. I struggled a little bit with small errors from grok because of certain missed punctuations in the code. Chatgpt was also very helpful with fixing and improving the code although Grok is a more powerful system. We also created out videos today and I felt like I didn't have enough to say for this week so next week I will work harder to come up with better accomplishments. I also think I should do more research on my current project because I feel a little hazy with the work Im doing.
