what_i_learned: |
  Today I was still working on my code and still letting in run basically all day. Now that we have some new pc's we can start to run our code a little faster with better results. I started to look up ways to convert my code to c++ so it is not done manually. Hopefully code will be done running by tonoght.

  No Blockers
reflection: |
  I think that it took a long time for my code to run just like my group members. My run time is still extremely slow and could use a lot of work. Today also felt extra long and im not completly sure why. By tomorrow we will be meeting with Dr. Cole with new updates.
