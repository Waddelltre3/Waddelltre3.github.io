what_i_learned: |
  Today we started off the day playing the game Taboo to get the competitive spirit out of everyone. It was a fun and enjoyable bonding experience for everyone. Then we played jenga as teams. Then we learned how to use overleaf which is a good way for researchers to create scicentific documents. It seems pretty easy to use and master and possibly something that I could put on my resume.

reflection: |
  Today was fun and a good way to see everyones competitiveness. I'm also glad we got to talk to administration about some possible events we could possibly do. Im also glad I got to use overleaf so I can put on my resume as something that I know how to do. My group also got to start working on the real code of our project. It is a lot harder than I expected but im ready for the challenge. I also got to speak to another professor about my project and he really opened my eyes to thinking like an engineer when it comes to research.
