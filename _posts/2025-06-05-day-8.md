what_i_learned: |
  Today I took a tour around Morgan's campus and I didn't neccesarily get to learn anything but I was able to show other students that I've met around campus. After that I learned about how to use GAD's online services to check how my stipen would come. In relation to working in the lab we got to work starting the plan to building our code. My grad mentor taught us to visualize to outcome of our project before we start anything so that when it comes to the actually process of building the code we have the specific steps to take to make the outcome we want. Then we are learning how to use AI to help with the frame work of building example code for the paper we had to read. This was taught me how to read my code and for errors and problem solve when things didn't go exactly the way I wanted them to.

reflection: |
  The things I did today were a little exhasting but it was fun. First we walked around campus to show the others intern that didn't go to morgan what the campus looked like. It was tiring because the campus is kinda large and it was humid outside. After that we had lunch then went to the labs. The lab today was more of a teaching lesson of how to problem solve. I've always been pretty good at problem solving but it is completely different when it comes to coding. Coding problem solving could cause you to rewrite your entire code. I also learned how to use LLMS as a way to build and edit code as a way to teach me about python. Google colab was also helpful with explaining errors.
