what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on a two mini projects that taught us how to go through the code to learn what the purpose of it. The two projects were related to machine learning applications that detect spam eamil and manage it as well as weather forecast. The second project was more difficult than the third and I needed Grok AI and Chat GPT to explain to me why I had faults in the code. With the help of the AI I was able to improve the code and get a better output.

reflection: |
  Today was the same as yestersday. We all worked on the mini coding projects again to help our understanding of the work that we will be doing. It was boring to sit here and do the same thing but I hope that will help do better when it comes time to work on the real project. I did't do much learning today outside of building a new code but this a new start.
