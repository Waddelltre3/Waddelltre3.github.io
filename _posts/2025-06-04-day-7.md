what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to properly use AI when conducting research on the spefic topic that I am learning about. I am also learned about other LLM models that would help me conduct my research and alsp explain key details from different perspectives. These include claude, grok, open AI, GPT.4, and copilot. These diffrent AI recources were extremely helpful. I also took many notes about the important steps. My grad student mentor also taught me how to ask proper questions and what to question in specific data sets.

reflection: |
  Today was an easy day. We still worked on trying to understand the concept of our project. Orginally I was using the website "notebook lm" to to interpret the information on the document. Although it eas helpful Grok AI was a much better took to use when it came to breaking down each concept. I did a lot of annotating and notes of the infortion that I had learned as well. Some of the information on the project plan doesn't really make a lot of sense at the moment. The math equations is what is tripping me up but I tried to start breaking down each problem with the help of the AI tools. I don't really have any other ideas at the moment to help come up with the next steps to move forward with the project. My main objective at the momemnt is to find libraries of code that will be useful and use my previous C++ coding experience to understand some of the python.
