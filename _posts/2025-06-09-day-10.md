what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about some example code that is close in relation to the actual project that we will actually be working on. The coding is becoming more familiar and I am able to start making edits to the code on my own to make it better. Practicing on this little project code is interesting because it doesn't require an insane amount on lines to create the finised product. Also I learned how to collect and download data files on google colab.

reflection: |
  The day was a liitel boring and I didn't have much to do outside of learning and building the exmaple code. My grad mentor wasn't able to come in today because of a family emergency but we were still able to make progress with understanding the assignment. I am ready to actually start the project and I feel like we took a little to much time to get an understanding of what we are doing. Hopefully tomorrow we can actually start working on the real code. I am ready to learn more about the actual project and get more hands on.
