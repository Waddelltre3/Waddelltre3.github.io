what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a second workshop that basically went in depth about writing and presenting for the upcoming presentation we      have. The workshop was informative and did have good recourses avaiable to the student researchers. We were able to create     mockdrafts and short example paragraphs for the essay that we have coming up. Back in the lab we worked on splitting up what   each team member is goign write and we took a look at the hardware.

reflection: |
  Although the workship is informative it felt like a waste of time. We need time to finish our project and the workshop was     inforation that could've been used earlier in the program. As a gorup we easily spit up the responsibilties with the work      that we need to do and things are running smoothly.
