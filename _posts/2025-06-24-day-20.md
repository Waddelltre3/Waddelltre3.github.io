what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on the power point presentation for the Mid-Term presentation and it was more of a refining day. I made sure that i mentioned imporatant steps that we as group worked on. I leanred a little bit more about the presentation today and that my group should take adavantage of the video that basically explainst what we are doing. I also able to get some insight on my slides from my grad student mentor about details that are generic.

  Today was am easy going day starting off with a check in with Dr. Mack. She was able to answer some questions for those that didn't know what we would be doing in the presentation. Her explanations also helped calm some nerves about the presentation as well and shortening the time limits to 15 minutes. I plan to work on the project a little more tomorrow and get my code running.
