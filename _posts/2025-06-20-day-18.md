what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned a lot more about my code. Outside of building the code and improving the model. My issue with the code is the LLM's beause they help create code but take out key factors of what is needed for my output. I need to be more detailed with what I am asking for in the LLM to get a responsive output. I was able to get an accuracy of 85% but when I used the LLM it took my accuracy to 0%.

reflection: |
  Today felt a lot better when it came to learning what the issue what my code was. With the help of my grad student mentor I was able to problem solve what the issues were in my code and what I was missing. Also we had to do a midterm check in with our professor to basically present what our current progress was. This was extremely helpful because he was able to give some important insight for the upcoming presentation for our group. Hopefully we can start to implement the code into hardware sometime next week after presentation.
