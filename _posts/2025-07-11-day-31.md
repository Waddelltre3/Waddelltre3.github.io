what_i_learned: |
  Today I was able to make some finalize improvement with my code to make an output of 85% accuracy with my clean images. I also was able to learn a little more about learning my LLM's and converting my code to C++. I plan to transfer my code to C++ next week to get a head start and make some progress.

reflection: |
  Today was easy but tiring. I had my code run all day and it came up with some good results. It was also a little weird making our team video with our group member missing but he will be back next week.
