what_i_learned: |
  Today my group made some good progress with the code. Pedro was able to create a code with some outstanding responses and now we just have to find a way to run the code without continuosly buying more gpu. I think our next steps to have Dr. Cole help us run the code on a better platform to run the code off cpu.

  I think that my group has made pretty good progress so far and that we should start working off the group member with the best code so far which is pedro. The reason I say that is so we can start transfering the code to C++. Once that is done and it will be pretty quick then we can input our code into the IoT devices.
