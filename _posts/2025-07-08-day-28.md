what_i_learned: |
  Today we were working on perfecting our code again. The main purpose at this point is to have our code to have sufficient result and accuracy. I took one of my teammates code and used it to compare to what I was working and see why his outcome is higher than mine. We also had our grad student mentor run the codes on more powerful computers. We plan to start working on changing the code to C++ now.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty simple and going back to what we were working on before the presenations were due. We also made some good progress with the code and I am ready to start converting to C++. I think that my code could use somemore work and I can learn with LLM's. Hopefully by firday we start the conversion process.
