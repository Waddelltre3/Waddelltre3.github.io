what_i_learned: |
  Today we had another enrichment block period where we all got to meet with eachother and discuss problematic topics with turning assignemnts. Everyone also got to meet with teachers that are assigneed to specifc group and we did a few ice breakers to get to know each other. Then I went straight to the lab to disect my improved code to find out what my errors were. The error came from me not telling the code actually produce the answer. Once I had the figured out it was easy to start my code and it gave out some sufficent anwsers.
blockers: |
  The only blockers that I had were long ru times with the code.
reflection: |
  Today was the best day this week so far because I finally got my improved code to work. Also the teacher assigned to my group was pretty cool and seemed interested in the work that we will be doing. The code took alot time to resend epochs which was annoying and my run time was almost two hours long. Now I need to use my LLM's to explain exactly what my code did so I can use it for future references. I also plan to work on the presentation we have for next week.
