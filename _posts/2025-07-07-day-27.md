what_i_learned: |
  We worked on the code today and started unboxing parts of our hardware systems. The hardware included many things such as      drones, automated landing devices, computers, and cars. These devices were extremely expensive so we had go through each       devices to make sure they were properly working and turned on. It was pretty simple stuff and I got to learn a little more     about what I'm working on.

  Today was pretty easy and straight foreward. Now that the presenatation is over with, we can get back to the important workt   that needs to get done. I think that I will be extremely helpful when it comes to the hardware. I am a very hands on person    so it was easy for me to get an understanding of it. Now we just need to finish our code.
