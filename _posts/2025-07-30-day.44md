what_i_learned: |
  Today was good last day of working in the lab. We were able to go over the presentation to figure out what needed to be corrected and to properly go over the flow of the slides. Everything is looking very good and I'm appreciated for CEAMLS to allow me to work on this research project.

reflection: |
  Today was easy and good to be the last day in the lab. I hope that I will be able to present in the beginning of the day tmr so we can get our project over with. I'm happy that our project came to a close and we made great progress as group for people that knew nothing about artificial intelligence.
