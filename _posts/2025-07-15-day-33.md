what_i_learned: |
  Today we met with a lady that taught about our learning styles and my personality. This information couldve been used earlier in the program to figure out what each group member can specifically apply to our project. We also had to make another mini presentation based on our traits. We also met with Dr. Cole and he basically gave a layout of what needs to be accomplished this week.

reflection: |
  I think that the beginning of today was an extreme waste of time that could've been used toward our project. We are very behind with the project according to Dr.Cole and testing needs to be done as soon as possible. By friday we should have our code transfered to C++ and ready to be put in the devices. I am feeling rushed now and work needs to be done.
