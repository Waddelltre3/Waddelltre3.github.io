what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about Python coding and actually getting to write a little bit of my own code. As a group we all did a little bit of machine learning code as a teaching example of how to build and edit Python Code. Majority of the time we were working on a machine learning project. We also went through some slides and videos that taught about supervised learning and unsupervised learning. It basically was about how machine learning is achieved throguh diverse ways. Supervised learning has labeled data sets for the system to learn off of patterns. Unsupervised learning is using unlabel data to have the machine discvor patterns on its owen.

reflection: |
  The day was easy but it was also a little confusing because Im not commpletely used to readying Python code. As a group we did work on a example project that was basically explaing how to use the python code in a similar example to what we will be actually doing.
