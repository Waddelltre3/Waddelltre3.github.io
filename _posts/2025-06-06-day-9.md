what_i_learned: |
  Today was a good day to get to finally meet everyone in person espcially the faculty and Grad Student mentors. The group as a whole got to learn what CEAMLS is about. We also had Dr. Waters come in and talk to us about the steps to properly conduct research. She talked about research questions and variables and the importance of them. I got the opportunity to talk to the people in my group and finally get to know eachother through ice breakers. I learned about cybersecruity and the key compoenets of how it will be implemented within my project.

reflection: |
  The day was pretty esay but just long. I got to meet with my group meembers and overall people within CEAMLS. Today was a good was to get acclimated to the research project. The groups did a "team bonding" activity that included Dr. Cole and my grad student mentor. We didn't win but as a team so far we have good team chemisty. We also got to meet with our group members alone with the faculty so that we can all get a better understanding of the project. Cybersecurity plays a large role in the project and I would've never thought that I would enjoy this but im starting to like it. Im ready to face the hard challenges ahead and start coding.
