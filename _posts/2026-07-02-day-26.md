what_i_learned: |
  Today my group was able to finish and make final corrections on our Mid Summer Presentation slides. With the help my grad student mentor we were able to change to some of the information so it wouldn't lead us open to many question. I learned that a good goal to have in mind when making a presentation is to answer any all questions before they are asked.

reflection: |
  I'm am happy that my group was able to finish and complete our presention because it took up a lot of our time. Im hoping that with a little bit of studying the information it will be easy to say to the listeners of the presentation. I am also glad that our grad mentor was extremely helpful with teachings us how to present the information with leaving questions unanswered. I am confident that our presenation will go well.
