what_i_learned: |
  Today my group was able to get some final feedback on our presentation. Most of the slides that we worked are complered and approved by Dr. Cole. There are some minor changes that I need to add to my slides like my personal growth and more of a visual aspect to the slides. I learned that the audience is looking more for personal growth than what goals I am supposed to meet.

reflection: |
  I feel like today was extremely product with finishing up our presentation. There are a little more things that I feel that should be changed by tomorrow morning. I am ready to present and get our project over with because it is taking up too much time. I also think that I need to practice my parts a little because Im not completely sure about them.
