what_i_learned: |
  Today I went back to working on my code. I wasn't able to find out why my training accuracy and meta loss are still at zero percent. I plan to look at my collegues code and compare them too see why my code isn't producing the same outcome. I also learned a little bit more about my own project when I started to pull information together about the data that has been collected.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty good after recieving the first pay check from the internship. I feel like confient about our project but we have a long way to go as a group. The work load today also wasn't as heavy since the presentation got pushed back to next week.
