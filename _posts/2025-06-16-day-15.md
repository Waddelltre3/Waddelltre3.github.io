what_i_learned: |
  Today I was using my LLMS to create a model python code for the project. Everyone in our group is creating their own separate codes then we compare then to see the diffrence. The LLM's give useful insight when it comes to decifering the code but not so good at creating relaible code. I use ChatGPT the most because it has proved to be a more reliable source than GROK for creating. I was able use an example code and comepare it to the article we had to read so now I am going to use chatgpt to improve the accuracy of the code.

  Today was soemwhat confusing to decifer different parts of the code because I kept getting errors on pieces of the code that I thought I fixed. My grad mentor was also helpful with fixing some of the errors. The run times were also pretty long with the epoch; my other group mates had major issues with the run time. It was also annoying that the LLM's kept getting pieces of my code wrong. Some of the issues consisted of not closing brackets.
