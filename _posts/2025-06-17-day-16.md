what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to correct the real code that finally worked. It took an extreme amount of time for the code to produce answer. I also took the code then put into LLM's with the article about the project that we are working on for a more improved code but it didn't really help much. The LLM's are used for creating code but they aren't extremly accurate making the code from scratch. I need to learn more about acually coding python to be useful for the project.

reflection: |
  I was extremely bored and tired today due to long run times and I felt like I haven't learned anything important recently. All I have been doing is using AI to create code but I wish I could actually learn python more often. The work is starting to become a little repetitive so at the momement I will try to learn more outside what is given by my grad mentor.
