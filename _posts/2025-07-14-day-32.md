what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on puting my code in the platform visual studio code. I had to download the code on my visual studio on my ipad and mac book which was a confusing process but I was able to get it to work. I did have an issue with my code actually running in visual studio so I have to go back to google collab for now.

  No Blockers
reflection: |
  The code should be done soon but we have a lot work to get done because we only have 3 weeks left in the program. With the help of our grad student mentor then we could get all codinf done this week but I wont be able to help out friday becaus I wont be here. I am ready to get started on transfering the code to hardware because we need to start testing.
