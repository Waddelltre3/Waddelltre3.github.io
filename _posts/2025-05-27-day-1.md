what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git & GitHub hub was about and how it will be implemented within the project. I got to meet my group memebers and others that are in CEAMLS. My group so far seems pretty cool and we all got to learna little bit about each other and we all go to Morgan State. I got to create my GitHub website as well. The Github website was a little confusing to figure out so I had a problem with trying to set up my page on the firsy day.

reflection: |
  It was a great opportunity today to meet with everyone. The things we did were not extremely complicated. The day was given just for everyone to get acclamated to the work that we would be doing. I am ready to get started learning how to program in python because it seems a lot easier than programming C++. I wish we had a longer amount of time to meet with the professor in charge of our project.
