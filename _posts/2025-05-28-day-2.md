what_i_learned: |
  I got to meet with the faculty members and mentors for CEAMLS. I got to meet with Dr. Cliston Cole and he explained what the project would revolve aorund using AI to predict unseen attacks. I was able to update my github website and learn how to make blog posts. I also learn the basics of python and it is very similar to C++ but simpler. Lastly we played the game "headbandz".

blockers: |
  My macbook died which delelted my phython code for submission.
  
reflection: |
  Learning more about the project that I will be working on, I am excited for the days to come and get working in the lab. I want to improve my Python skills and be able to program while being hands on with the project. Github seems pretty easy to navigate and is a good way to blog what I do throughout the day.
