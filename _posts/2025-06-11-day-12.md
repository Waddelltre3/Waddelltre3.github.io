what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about classifying text with support vector machines (SVM). I used real world data to clean and transform it into featues. I also learned about SVM's work, how to handle multiple categories, improve overall accuracy. Text classification is used for spam detection and categorization. I used the help of some LLMS to break down pieces of the code that I didn't understand and hekp me improve the code.

reflection: |
  The work today was pretty easy and with the help of my Grad mentor. It was orginally confusing trying to read and understand the code so I had to take a break and come back to what I was working on. I also used two separate LLM's to help me come up with a finished product of what I was looking for. The hardest park was figuring out how to come up with a more precise output. Also we got to start creating the code for the actual project based off the first article we read.
