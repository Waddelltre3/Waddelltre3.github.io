what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned more about my group project and read an article that specifcally gives details on the project that I am working on. The projects basic description is about the META- Learning for adversarial robustness(META-Adv). This is basicalling talking about how to creat/enhance machine learnings ability to adapt to unseen tasks/attacks. I also learned about the many disadvantages that come with training AI.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty much a chill day and I enojoyed learning about my project. From my undestanding the project is based on creating an AI/Machine Learning platform that will be trained to recognize and adapt unforseen attacks. The training consists of image learning and with hundreds of thousands of images that consists of different obejcts to trian the platform. The problem with this is that it is very difficult because the data that is needed and extremely diverse. My idea to fix this idea is to have the platform have access to the web. Almost how chatgpt can get access to the web because then our platfrom could teach itself by looking things up.
