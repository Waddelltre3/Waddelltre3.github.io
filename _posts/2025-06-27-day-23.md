what_i_learned: |
  I was still working on my code today based off of the information that my grad mentor was giving me. I need to go back to the article that we read to find out what the issue with my code was. As far as the presentation we still have some adjustments to make such as making the video on monday to explain the model and what it is doing.

reflection: |
  I think today was easy but a little repetetive. Im hoping by next week that everyone's code with be finsihed and done with so that we can start phase 2. Phase 2 should be easy and right up my alley because I can understand C++ way easier than python. Im also hoping that we can practive our presentation for next week on monday.
