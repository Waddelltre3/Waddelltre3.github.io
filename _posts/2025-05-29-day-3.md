what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about computer vision. We used the website "Teachable Machines" and "Google Collab" to create computer vision. We trained the computer to learn specific objects and images. Andrew Kelly was the person that helped us learn more about computer vision and how to code it. I learned more about python which included wage calculators, I/O cycles, digital profiles, coverting string to integers, variables, and type casting.

reflection: |
  Today was fun and easy. I enjoyed learning about computer vision and how to code it. I also enjoyed playing in the espace room. My team espaced first and we had good chemistry when it came to finishing the project. The python was also fun today, I enjoyed the challenge and Im ready to learn more.
