what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on the power point presentation for the Mid-Term presentation this upcoming friday. I gathered the information I have built up over this past month and putting it into the power point. I learned that I dont need to put lots of informtation up on the actual power point because readers will mostly listen to me and the slide show is just for reminders and keeping track of what i'm speaking about. There is a lot details in what we have done so far but there is a long way to go. My current code that I have now is not working yet so I still have some adujustments to make.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty easy but it did require a lot thinking and reflecting. I think that this power point will be easy but I am worried about meeting the time requiremnt of 20 minutes. I think that it is very possible to get it done but I don't think my entire team has done anything substatial enough yet to make that long of a presentation. I still have a lot work to do with updating my code but it should be easy.
