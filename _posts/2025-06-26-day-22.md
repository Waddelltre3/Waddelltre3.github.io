what_i_learned: |
  I went back to working on my code today. It wasn't neccesarily frustrating but took a long time to figure out why my code wasn't doing what I built it to do. I also looked back at my baseline code to figure out why it is getting the results Im looking for, but not my current code. I did see an improvement with my meta loss being at 0.00%. 
blockers: |
  No Blockers
reflection: |
  I did a lot of brainstorming to figure out why my code wasn't acting properly. My group aldo got a brief moment before lunch time to talk to Dr. Cole about our slide show presentation. We are moving a long pretty well with the presentation and should be comepleted by monday of the following week. We decided to take a diffrent apporach with the slide and add a visual aspect to catch the readers attention.
