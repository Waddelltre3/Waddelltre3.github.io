what_i_learned: |
  Today I was working maily on the presentation trying to make it more engaging for the audience and I was able to get everyones data for one of the slides that I was assigned. I originally started off with working on my code to make improvements but I needed to make a lot more corrrections with the presentation. So far 85% of our slides are finished but we need to go over them with Dr. Cole.

reflection: |
  I feel like we are making a lot of goof progress as a group. We also made the video in our presentation extra long as a strategy to help shorten our presentation time. The work so far has been pretty good but I do feel like the Mid summer presentation is slowing my group down of the work that we actually need to get done.
