  Today I learned about conditionals in Python which is not too far off from C++. We also learned about Gen AI and how is it used and developed.

reflection: |
  It was a cool day today. We did a lot of Kahoot which was extremely competitive to help lock in the knowledge we just learned. We also took a pre-survey to basically list the expectations of what we are expecting from the program. I also did my CITI training certificates which was pretty easy. The things we learned about gen AI was extremely interesting and I plan to take time to learn more about it myself. We also learned about how to depict reguqlr images from AI created images.
