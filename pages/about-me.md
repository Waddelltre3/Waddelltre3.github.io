  bio: |
    I’m currently a Sophomore studying Mechatronics Engineering at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work explores proactive defense systems for unforseen adversarial attacks.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy learning about cars, excercising, and playing baseball.
