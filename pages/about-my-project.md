subtitle: Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks
project_title: "Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks"

problem : |
    Today challenges in existing cyber defense systems are majorly reactive against known
adversarial attacks but not to unseen attacks. The growing concerns with current defense
mechanisms are solely relying on static rules and predefined signatures to protect against
threats. How can we improve defense systems to stay ahead of the constantly evolving threats?

approach: |
  Students will develop a state-of-the-art proactive detection system using a meta-learning
approach for unseen cyberattacks on IoT. The purpose of the proactive detection system is to
serve as a tool to recognize non-traditional features that are used to launch malicious
cyberattacks due to vulnerabilities being exploited in AI systems as a solution in cybersecurity
applications.

  In this proposed work, the goals are to (1) develop a meta-learning-based proactive defense
system to defend against unforeseen malicious adversarial attacks; (2) upload the codes used
for proactive defense system to IoT devices, and (3) to conduct test and evaluation (T&E) to
measure their performances against unforeseen attacks in real-time. In this project, we will
implement meta-learning-enabled adversarial training (Meta-Adv) model, which is the
framework for implementing Proactive Defense System to improve predicting unforeseen
cyberattacks. The goals can be achieved by the following objectives: (1) to access benchmark datasets for adversarial training and testing; (2) the implementation of meta-training of the Meta-
Adv model; (3) the implementation of meta-testing of the Meta-Adv model; (4) conduct T&E to analyze the accuracy against attacks on benchmark datasets; (5) to convert the Python-based
Meta-Adv model to C++; (6) upload C++-based Meta-Adv model to IoT devices; and (7) to
execute T&E plan on IoT devices and measure their performances against unforeseen attacks.
Successful completion will lead to potential answers for developing defense strategies against
novel attacks.

outcome: |
  The outcomes of this program will equip participants with advanced skills in communication
networking, cybersecurity, and ML systems tailored for cyberattack detection on IoT devices.
Students will have opportunities to advance critical thinking skills in conducting basic
research to develop complex ML systems by understanding legend ML algorithms for detecting
cyberattacks. Additionally, they will acquire basic software programming skills in developing a
ML system, system integration for IoT devices, and software configuration for networking by
exchanging data over wireless links. Moreover, contribution to this project complements
security solutions for IoT safety and the protection of data information across data links in
communication networks.
